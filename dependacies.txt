⚙️ 1. CORE DEPENDENCIES

Run these from your project root:

npm install react-router-dom @tanstack/react-query @supabase/supabase-js

Why:

react-router-dom → For routing (Dashboard, Login, Fuel, Stock pages)

@tanstack/react-query → Data fetching + caching (great with Supabase)

@supabase/supabase-js → SDK to connect to your Supabase project

🎨 2. UI & ICONS
npm install lucide-react classnames

Why:

lucide-react → Clean icons (e.g., fuel pump, products, settings)

classnames → For conditional Tailwind class management

🧩 3. COMPONENT LIBRARY (Optional but Recommended)

We’ll use shadcn/ui components — built on top of Radix UI, styled with Tailwind.
Run this setup command:

npx shadcn@latest init


Then install required peer dependencies:

npm install clsx tailwind-variants radix-ui react-hook-form


After that, you can generate components as needed:

npx shadcn@latest add button card input dialog table

Why:

They give you:

ready-to-use Button, Card, Dialog, Table components

consistent styling with your Tailwind theme

📊 4. DATA VISUALIZATION (Dashboard Charts)
npm install recharts

Why:

For building charts like:

daily fuel sales

tank volume gauges

top-selling stock items

🌀 5. ANIMATIONS
npm install framer-motion

Why:

To add smooth transitions in modals, charts, and dashboards.

🔑 6. AUTHENTICATION HELPER (optional now)
npm install jotai

Why:

A lightweight global state manager — perfect for holding user auth/session info from Supabase.

We’ll use it to store the logged-in user profile, role, and station context.

🧠 7. DEV UTILITIES (optional but useful)
npm install eslint prettier --save-dev

Why:

Keeps your code clean and consistent — especially when project scales.

Then initialize them:

npx eslint --init

🧭 8. VERIFY INSTALLS

Once all commands are done, check everything installed correctly:

npm list --depth=0
